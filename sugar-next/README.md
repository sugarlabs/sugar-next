# Sugar Next — A Learning Shell for Everyday Computing

## What this is

Sugar Next is a **sibling project** to the classic Sugar desktop, not a fork
and not a replacement. It lives under the [Sugar Labs](https://www.sugarlabs.org/)
umbrella and leaves the `sugar` (jarabe) repository completely untouched.
PR #1019 (the GTK4 port of the classic shell) continues on its own track.

Sugar Next is a place to explore what a modern, low-floor learning
environment could look like — using the technologies available today
(GTK4, Wayland, Python, XDG) — while the classic stack continues to serve
the XO hardware and existing deployments.

## Rationale

Sugar's founding insight was the **low floor**: a child could look inside
their computer and change it. Twenty years on, the stack that carried that
idea has quietly raised the floor out of reach:

- **GTK3 + X11** — both deprecated upstream. The GTK4 port of the shell
  (PR #1019) stalled on environment friction, not on technical difficulty:
  nobody could easily *run* what they were porting.
- **Autotools** — a build system most of today's contributors have never
  seen.
- **The activities-only bubble** — the shell only shows XO-style bundles.
  Firefox, the terminal, GIMP: invisible. The user is isolated from their
  own computer.
- **A high barrier for creators** — writing a Sugar activity means
  learning GObject Introspection, the activity lifecycle, D-Bus, and the
  build system before printing "hello".
- **No reproducible dev environment** — the recommended setup is a 1 GB
  Live ISO tied to a specific distro version.

The community is active — the energy exists. Sugar Next is a place to
point some of it at *evolving* the environment instead of only maintaining
it.

Full design principles: [HIG.md](HIG.md).

### What Sugar Next deliberately does not do

- Touch the `sugar` repo, jarabe, or PR #1019 — the legacy shell stays
  exactly as it is.
- Migrate existing XO activities to a new API (a compat layer may come
  later, if the community wants it).
- Reimplement legacy mesh collaboration (the protocols are specific to the
  XO hardware and are not being recreated here).

## Status

This is a **rapid prototype**. Things change fast, break, and get rewritten
as we learn what works. We use [OpenSpec](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec)
to track every change — see `openspec/changes/` for the active proposals,
designs, and task lists. If something doesn't work, **that is expected**,
and a fix is probably already in progress.

**The developer experience is a pillar of this project.** Sugar Next aims
to be as easy to hack on as it is to use. If setting up the dev
environment, running tests, or understanding the code feels harder than it
should, that is a bug — please report it.

## Quick start

Requires GTK4 and PyGObject from your distro:

| Distro | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Fedora | `sudo dnf install python3-gobject gtk4` |
| Debian/Ubuntu | `sudo apt install python3-gi gir1.2-gtk-4.0` |
| Arch | `sudo pacman -S python-gobject gtk4` |

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar-next.git
cd sugar-next/sugar-next
./bootstrap.sh
sugar-next
```

> Note: the `sugar-next/` directory inside the repo is the actual project.
> Clone the whole repo, then `cd sugar-next/sugar-next` to find the shell.

For Podman, pip install, and development instructions see the full
[HIG.md](HIG.md) and the `openspec/` change documents.
